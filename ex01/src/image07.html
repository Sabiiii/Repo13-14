    <p>
        Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival.
        Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both. Humans can hold their
        breath
        underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.

        Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and in some countries, swimming lessons
        are a
        compulsory part of the educational curriculum. As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local,
        national,
        and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.
